How to convert files

The converted file is automatically downloaded to your computer. If you're not prompted where to save the file, you'll find it in the "Downloads" folder on your computer.
Privacy Policy

This public service is intended to provide simple functions to convert any vCard file into another format. It was created for personal needs and is now provided on a private and non commercial basis. The uploaded file will not be stored permanently nor will the converted addresses be kept on the server.

You can also download the script and run it locally. All you need is a webserver or a shell with PHP installed. This software is free and open source and everybody is welcome to help us improving it. Fork us on github!
